h1. Arduino Modeling

This contains the required projects to execute arduino models created with "Arduino Designer":https://github.com/mbats/arduino, using the modeling workbench from "Gemoc Studio":https://github.com/gemoc/gemoc-studio.

To use it you need to launch a Gemoc Studio with the projects located in language_workbench imported in your workspace.
You can then import the ifdemo project, located in the modeling_workbench folder, and create a new "Gemoc Sequential eXecutable Model" debug configuration, specifying the model to execute (in our case /ifdemo/model.arduino), the xDSML to use (arduino), and the animator (/ifdemo/model.aird).

In the debug view, in suspended state, the stackframe at the bottom of the stack shows the mutable data of the model in the variable view.
These mutable fields can be modified in the same way as the eclipse java debugger.
